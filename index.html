        Food deserts are geographical zones that are deprived of supermarkets,
        organic foods, and often contain fast foods instead. They are affecting
        the health and well-being of millions of Americans, and they are found
        mainly in the South.

      <h2>The Issue</h2>
      <p>
        The rise of food deserts in America is a major issue. They are directly
        linked to obesity, diabetes, and risk of heart attacks for those who live
        in one (Cerceo, 2023). People who live in a food desert automatically
        have less access to nutritious foods that would benefit their health.
        Studies show that taking care of what you eat can have a direct impact on
        your long-term health and even focus during the day, which can impact
        performance (Hu et al., 2002).

      <h2>What Are the Solutions?</h2>
      <p>
        There are ongoing solutions to resolve the food desert crisis. Farmers
        markets are an effective way of providing nutritious, organic foods to
        food desert residents. In addition, mobile farmers markets allow the
        organizations to come to the neighborhoods and make a direct impact on
        the community.

      <h2>How Can You Help?</h2>
      <p>
        You can also make an impact in these food deserts by contacting your local
        district representative and asking how food deserts are being mitigated in
        your area or if you are at risk. Donating to one organization can make a
        massive impact on someone's ability to receive the food they need.
